# NintendontFolderGenerator

### Nintendont Folder Generator
* A tool to generate the folder structure for Nintendont
    * Link to Nintendont: https://github.com/FIX94/Nintendont

### Setup to get this tool working
* Have GameCube games in .iso or .ciso format
* Open the tool (you'll need the latest JDK installed for that)
    * Link to JDK: https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/
* Press Select Folder with Games and then the tool will prompt for a folder to look for your GameCube games
    * It will look through subfolders as well
    * It will automatically create the folder if games are in the folder selected
* Please be patient when your folder is being generated. It'll look like nothing is happening, but wait for the confirmation that it's done
* Move that newly created folder onto the root of your SD card or USB
  * This can now be done automatically for you after generation. 
  * Unfortunately no Linux support since I don't have a Linux machine to test this with, so you still have the move the folder manually
* Have fun playing your games on your Wii or Wii U!

### Note for Multi Disc Games
* For multi disc games, your discs must have (Disc 1) and (Disc 2) in their file names
  * This tool will not work correctly otherwise for multi disc games
  * Generally have your notation of disc number at the end (this tool assumes this notation for multi disc games)
    * Example: Game Title (Disc Number)
